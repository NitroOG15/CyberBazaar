Build me a fully functional, single-page cyberpunk web app called "Black Market Bazaar" where users browse an underground marketplace of illegal futuristic goods. The entire experience should be atmospheric, immersive, and include a plot twist reveal.

GOAL & STORY:

At first, the user thinks they are shopping for illegal cyberware items.
Behind the scenes, the site tracks which items they click on and uses that to build a "profile" about them.
The twist: When they click on a final special item, the app reveals that THEY are actually the product being sold.
REQUIREMENTS:

DESIGN / THEME
Cyberpunk, neon-glitch aesthetic (deep blacks, neon blues/pinks/purples, glitch effects).
Use a grid of product cards with hover animations, flickering/glitch text.
Background: dark, animated with subtle glitch lines or pixel noise.
Fonts: futuristic and glitchy (Orbitron, Share Tech Mono, or similar from Google Fonts).
Include a looping cyberpunk background soundtrack (optional, can use HTML5 audio with an mp3 link).
Responsive design for desktop & mobile.
PRODUCT LIST
Display 8-12 fake cyberware items with name, fake price, image, and short dystopian description.
Example items:
"Synthetic Emotion Synthesizer"
"Stolen Childhood Memories"
"Neural Cortex Overclockers"
"Optic Cloak Implants"
"Quantum Reflex Enhancer"
"Sentient AI Companion Chip" ← SPECIAL trigger item
Each product should have:
Title
Fake price (in ¥ credits)
Image (can use free cyberpunk product images or AI-generated placeholders)
Short dark description (20-30 words)
Hidden tags for traits/personality (example: stealth, rebellion, curiosity, danger).
INTERACTIVITY & PROFILE TRACKING
Every time the user clicks a product, store:
Product name
Hidden personality tags (defined in code)
Store clicks in an in-memory array (no need for database).
Each product contributes to a hidden "profile" object about the user.
Example: Clicking "Optic Cloak Implants" adds "stealthy" to their traits; "Stolen Memories" adds "morally ambiguous."
THE TWIST
If the user clicks the special "Sentient AI Companion Chip" product:
Fade screen to black with glitch transition.
Replace product grid with a single "Final Listing" card.
FINAL LISTING PAGE CONTENT:
Image: Mosaic/collage made from thumbnails of the products they clicked earlier.
Title: Generated cyberpunk alias → create from a list of adjectives + nouns, example:
Adjectives: Chrome, Neon, Ghost, Shadow, Iron, Toxic, Omega, Quantum
Nouns: Wraith, Vulture, Serpent, Hacker, Specter, Nomad, Phantom
Randomly combine one adjective + one noun.
Description: Auto-generate text from their browsing behavior, e.g.: "Subject shows interest in stealth optics and memory modification. High-risk tolerance detected. Suitable for corporate espionage. Estimated loyalty: 23%."
Price: Random dystopian currency value (¥80,000, 45,000 credits, etc.).
Button: Instead of “Buy Now,” show “LIST ON MARKET.”
Clicking “LIST ON MARKET” should show:
Fake buyer profile (name, avatar, buyer rating).
Fake "shipment tracking" number.
Creepy closing message: “You have been sold.”
TECH NOTES
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React preferred but not required).
Use TailwindCSS for styling with custom colors for neon effects.
Add CSS glitch effects for hover states and transitions.
No backend is required; all data can be simulated on the frontend.
If images are needed, use free placeholder images or AI-generated ones with a cyberpunk style.
DEPLOYMENT
Code should be exportable to deploy on Firebase Hosting.
All assets (images, audio, CSS) should be included in the project.
Keep code readable and modular so it’s easy to tweak for the hackathon.
EXTRA POLISH (if time allows):

Add subtle ambient particle effects in the background.
Animate product cards slightly when hovered.
Include easter eggs: If the user clicks only "dangerous" items, give them a special “high threat” profile.
Make the "LIST ON MARKET" button pulse or glitch for effect.
